# Tech-Blog-MVC
## About Tech-Blog-MVC

The purpose of this educational assignment was to practice the MVC (model/view/controller) and CRUD (create/read/update/delete) development process, creating an interactive 'tech blog'. 

1. Present user with homepage of posts
2. User cannot access the features until they are logged in
3. Users are prompted on the 'login' page to enter creditials or 'sign up'
4. New users are taken to a 'sign up' page to enter new creditials
5. After existing or new user logs in/signs up, they are taken to their 'dashboard'
6. On the dashboard, they can 'edit' their user info, 'create' a new post, and 'edit' existing posts
7. Additionally, users can click on each post on the 'homepage' and post comments
8. These comments can also be 'edited' and 'delete'
